## Introduction

This C program is designed to run on an ATMEGA32-16PU-ND microcontroller. It connects to an LED screen to display a clock, current date, and handle leap years. Additionally, it provides user interactions through a pinpad to modify the displayed values and toggle daylight savings time.

## Features

- Real-time clock display.
- Accurate date tracking, including leap years.
- User interaction via a pinpad to change date and time settings.
- Support for daylight savings time (DST) adjustments.
- Highly customizable and expandable codebase.

## Setup

To set up this project, you will need the following hardware components:

- ATMEGA32-16PU-ND microcontroller.
- LED screen.
- Pinpad for user input.
- Appropriate power supply and connections.

Make sure you have the necessary development environment and toolchain for programming the ATMEGA32 microcontroller. You might also need additional libraries for interfacing with the LED screen and pinpad.
