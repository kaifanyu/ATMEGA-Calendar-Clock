## Introduction

This C program is designed to run on an ATMEGA32-16PU-ND microcontroller. It connects to an LED screen to display a clock, current date, and handle leap years. Additionally, it provides user interactions through a pinpad to modify the displayed values and toggle daylight savings time.

## Features

- Real-time clock display.
- Accurate date tracking, including leap years.
- User interaction via a pinpad to change date and time settings.
- Support for daylight savings time (DST) adjustments.
- Highly customizable and expandable codebase.

## Setup
